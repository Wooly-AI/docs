## What is WoolyAI?

WoolyAI is a suite of software that helps companies simplify and maximize GPU hardware utilization, as well as reduce costs. WoolyAI operates like a GPU hypervisor for ML platforms.

- **Dynamic GPU Compute cores scheduling & allocation**: Measures and allocates GPU compute cores at runtime across multiple simultaneous kernel executions based on job priority and actual consumption.
- **VRAM Oversubscription and Swap Policy**: Supports VRAM overcommit at scheduling time to increase GPU packing, using an idleness-aware VRAM swapping policy to keep active working jobs resident.
- **Model Memory Deduplication for Higher Density**: VRAM dedup (e.g., shared base model weights across many LoRA adapters) to pack more models per GPU.
- **Works with existing ML CUDA pods**: No special container images needed. Requires installation of Wooly Client libraries inside existing ML cuda pods (Pytorch/vllM etc).
- **Ecosystem-friendly**: Works with your existing Kubernetes setup for GPU nodes. Requires setup of WoolyAI GPU operator.

### The Problem

Hardware is expensive and often underutilized. Instead of statically assigning fixed GPU resources upfront, WoolyAI makes allocation decisions in real-time based on actual usage. No coarse-grained time-slicing ot static partioning.

In short: WoolyAI is like "virtualization" for GPU resources. Rather than giving each user their own dedicated GPU (expensive and wasteful), WoolyAI measures what each workload actually needs and intelligently shares GPU cores and memory across many users in real-time.

### Advantages

- **Lower Infrastructure Costs**: Maximize utilization per GPU and reduce costs by allowing less GPU hardware to do more.
- **True GPU Concurrency**: Runs multiple kernel executions in a single GPU context without time-slicing overhead, unlike traditional static partitioning (MIG/MPS) that create rigid, underutilized segments.
- **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Real-time redistribution of GPU cores and VRAM based on active kernel processes, priority levels, and actual usage patterns - not fixed quotas.
- **Maximized GPU Utilization**: Eliminates idle cycles by continuously analyzing and optimizing resource distribution, ensuring no GPU compute sits unused.
- **Memory Sharing**: Deduplicates Model VRAM across multiple apps to save on expensive GPU memory. Share identical models in VRAM across multiple workloads.

## Deployment Options

WoolyAI can be deployed and used as a service in your organization, supporting multiple teams and models. There are three main ways to deploy WoolyAI:

1. WoolyAI Kubernetes GPU Operator (useful for small, medium, and large scale deployments **with** Kubernetes available)
2. WoolyAI Controller (useful for small, medium, and large scale deployments **without** Kubernetes available)
3. Direct to WoolyAI Server (useful for small scale deployments with one GPU node)

### WoolyAI Kubernetes GPU Operator

The WoolyAI GPU Operator handles deploying the WoolyAI Server pods on all GPU nodes in your cluster as well as injecting the WoolyAI libraries into the Kubernetes ML pods.

:::info
The WoolyAI GPU Operator is a Kubernetes helm chart.

### WoolyAI Controller for non-Kubernetes managed GPU nodes

The WoolyAI Controller is a router with a Web and REST API interface that is responsible for routing kernel execution requests from ML CUDA containers running with Wooly Client libraries to the GPU node cluster running WoolyAI Server.

:::info
The WoolyAI Controller can be deployed as a docker container (Dockerfile or Kubernetes).
:::

1. [Setup Guide for WoolyAI Controller](./controller/setup)
2. [Setup Guide for WoolyAI Server](./server/setup)
3. [Setup Guide to install WoolyAI libraries inside ML CUDA Containers](./client/setup)

### Direct to WoolyAI Server

The Direct to WoolyAI Server is a simple way to deploy WoolyAI on a single GPU node. You simply run the WoolyAI Server container and your ML CUDA container with Wooly Client libraries on the same machine.

:::info
No Kubernetes or Controller required.
