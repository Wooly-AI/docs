The Era of Unbound GPU Execution
Current GPU Consumption and Management: Today, GPU resource consumption and management in machine learning scope is constrained and highly inefficient. It’s constrained because of the dominance of CUDA in the ML software ecosystem and the consumption is inefficient because organizations have to choose between cost-efficiency, resource utilization, SLA goals and control when consuming GPUs from cloud service providers and/or setting up their own managed GPU clusters.
Every mode of GPU consumption today has significant challenges:
For cloud based GPU instances users have to pay for the full instance regardless of utilization or if they choose to use the dynamic workload scheduler service, they have to give up on the SLAs.
Serverless model API providers provide job run time based billing, however users need to give up control and visibility into their workload.
Tools or services that utilize Multi-process service (MPS) features of Nvidia are constrained due to MPS challenges in the areas of error containment and execution resource provisioning for Quality of Service (QoS). This prevents true efficient utilization of GOU across heterogeneous concurrent workloads with QOS management.
Users are then forced to choose between achieving high utilization or minimizing delays in execution.
The WoolyAI Breakthrough: WoolyAI is the only technology that enables concurrent execution of CUDA workloads on Nvidia GPUs along with QOS monitoring and management capabilities.
WoolyAI offers a game-changing CUDA abstraction layer that completely disrupts how GPU resources are consumed. Just as VMware transformed CPU and RAM resource management for servers, WoolyAI revolutionizes GPU consumption, enabling unprecedented control, efficiency, and flexibility. VMware started in 1998 in stealth mode amidst the dotcom bubble when servers with storage usage demand was at an all time high. They created technology to allow for virtual-workloads on a single physical server framework which transformed data centers and sowed the seed for on-demand virtual compute usage aka public clouds. Around 75% of x86 server workloads were virtualized by 2015 and  VMWare held the majority of the x86 server virtualization market, with over 50% share. Now we are a stealth startup who amidst this AI wave have made advancements in this space to switch execution on GPU infrastructure into a Workload Resource-Usage Schema – solving a lot of issues that cloud GPU and on-premise GPU users face alike. We are calling this the Unbound GPU Execution Era.
WoolyAI abstraction layer technology decouples the CUDA execution from the underlying GPU hardware while at the same time providing full control over GPU resource usage and performance parameters for execution of ML workloads.


What is WoolyAI Abstraction Layer - Our entire Wooly technology stack which decouples CUDA execution from App Layer tools like Pytorch and also from the underlying GPU hardware.

CUDA Abstraction At the App Layer (Pytorch)  - Pytorch source is compiled with Wooly CUDA SDK to produce Wooly Pytorch Binaries. Wooly Pytorch Binaries convert Pytorch Shaders into simplified Wooly Instruction Set (IS). At runtime, the Wooly Client library running in a non-GPU(CPU) environment transfers the Shaders over the network to the Wooly server Runtime running on a GPU host for execution. 
TensorFlow - Planned for future
CUDA Abstraction on the GPU Host - Wooly Server Runtime receives the Kernel Shaders in Wooly Instruction set and recompiles it. During recompilation, it adds management and control features which enable WoolyStack to provide maximum utilization of the GPU across concurrent workloads, accurate GPU resources usage measurement and support for execution across multiple GPU vendors. Currently, it generates Nvidia Runtime compatible code for Nvidia GPU hosts.
Heterogeneous GPU cluster (planned for future): With WoolyAI abstraction layer architecture we are able to support heterogeneous GPU clusters, including NVIDIA, AMD, and Apple Silicon. Using instruction set and custom runtime layers, Woolystack can dynamically generate and manage hardware-specific execution code, allowing PyTorch models to run efficiently across different GPU types without code changes.
AMD support  - Planned for the future.
Apple Silicon - Planned for the future








Product  - Phase 1 - In phase one rollout of WoolyAI technology to the market, we are focussing on GPU Resource allocation and measurement to provide efficient usage and performance management features to the users.
Introducing Workload Resource-Usage Schema based GPU consumption
Instead of hard-partitioning GPU or overpaying for unused GPU reserved/hold time, WoolyAI manages execution of multiple user workloads on GPU similar to how an Operating System manages execution of multiple applications. 
This allows for:
Efficient allocation of GPU memory and processing resources to every running workload
Maximum GPU utilization at all times
Flexible GPU memory and processing cycles allocation at runtime to meet pre configured SLA
Tracking of Workload Resource-usage metrics
Moving from "Time Used" to "Actual GPU Resources Used": With WoolyAI, organizations can transition from traditional cloud GPU consumption models—where users pay for the total time a GPU is occupied, whether or not it’s fully utilized—to a new paradigm where tracking, billing and chargeback is based on the actual GPU resources consumed. This is consistent across varying workloads, whether during peak demand or when the GPU infrastructure is lightly loaded.
WoolyAI Acceleration Service (SaaS) is like the AWS Lambda service for GPU Workloads
WoolyAI Acceleration Service functions as a cloud-native GPU consumption service. Users run their code on CPU instances, and GPU-based executions happen seamlessly through the WoolyAI Acceleration Service (SaaS). Resource Usage tracking and Billing is done based on "Wooly Units", which measure the precise GPU resources consumed. Users can select between different service tiers—Premium, Standard, or Basic—each offering varying levels of performance, with the option to pay more Wooly Units for faster execution and higher priority.
Benefits for the Users:
Pay for actual GPU usage, not idle time: Reduce costs significantly by only paying for the actual GPU resources consumed by your job, not the entire GPU instance.
Dynamic SLAs tailored to needs: Choose between different performance levels (Premium, Standard, Basic) to align costs with job urgency and performance requirements.
Seamless cloud GPU execution: Work inside already familiar CPU based ML container environments and offload the complexities of managing GPU resources.

For Enterprises - On-Premise and Air-Gapped public Cloud GPU Infrastructure - Planned for future
WoolyAI software stack can be deployed on-prem and in air-gapped public cloud private GPU environments to transform it into a Workload Resource-Usage Schema. 
Traditional on-prem solutions Run.ai(based on Nvidia MPS) or complex Kubernetes plugins tools often fall short in maximizing GPU utilization. WoolyAI changes the game by offering:
No more hard partitioning of GPUs for multi-user environments.
No complex shared infrastructure management with uncertain performance guarantees.
No special Kubernetes GPU plugin headaches to manage GPU infrastructure.
By deploying WoolyAI on-premise or in their air-gapped public cloud GPU environments, organizations can effortlessly expose their GPU clusters to user workloads running on CPU instances, with automatic SLA management and optimized GPU utilization. This setup guarantees that every workload gets the resources it needs without wasting valuable GPU resources.
Product - Phase 2
Beyond Nvidia: Towards a Heterogeneous GPU Future WoolyAI’s abstraction of GPU kernel execution from the underlying hardware allows it to support heterogeneous GPU clusters, including both Nvidia and AMD GPUs, regardless of your code being written in CUDA or ROCm. This flexibility paves the way for organizations to leverage the best available hardware and expand their options, without being locked into a single vendor.
The WoolyAI Advantage:
Maximize GPU Utilization: Achieve 100% usage of GPU resources across workloads, avoiding the inefficiencies of hard partitioning or idle instances.
Flexible, Cost-Efficient Billing: Pay only for the GPU resources your job actually uses, with the ability to choose SLA-based performance levels.
Simplified GPU Management: Eliminate the complexity of managing shared GPU infrastructure with automatic, dynamic resource allocation.
Support for Heterogeneous GPU Clusters: Combine Nvidia and AMD GPUs in the same infrastructure with seamless management and scheduling across hardware types.
